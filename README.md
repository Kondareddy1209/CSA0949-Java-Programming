# CSA0949-Java

## Overview

This repository contains Java solutions for various coding problems categorized by difficulty: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**. The repository is part of my personal practice for improving Java skills and solving coding challenges. Each folder contains solutions to problems from different platforms, coded in Java with clear and readable logic.

## Features

- **Easy**: Basic problems suitable for beginners, focusing on loops, arrays, strings, and basic algorithms.
- **Medium**: Intermediate problems covering sorting, searching, recursion, and dynamic programming concepts.
- **Hard**: Advanced problems dealing with data structures like trees, graphs, and complex algorithmic challenges.
- **Well-organized**: Problems are organized into folders based on difficulty, allowing easy navigation.
- **Readable Code**: Solutions are commented to explain logic and methodology.
